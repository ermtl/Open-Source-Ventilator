Hello ermtl,

I'm a Software Engineering graduate student at the University of Maryland Global Campus. My capstone course has recently made the decision to focus on the current global issue of COVID-19 and the lack of viable ventilators.

We're looking to contribute to the effort of mass production of low-cost ventilators. After doing some research, we stumbled upon your project and would love to contribute in any way we can. If you wouldn't mind, could you get in touch with me to discuss options for moving forward? We have a diverse team of software and mechanical engineers that want nothing more than to assist in this most pressing issue. Please feel free to contact me at any time at rcohan08@gmail.com.

We look forward to working with you!

All the best,

Ryan Cohan
